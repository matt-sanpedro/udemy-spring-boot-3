# INITIALIZATION #
- by default, when app starts all bean are initialized (@Component, etc.)
- Spring creates an instance of each

# LAZY INITIALIZATION #
- instead of creating all beans up front, only initialized when:
	1. needed for dependency injection
	2. explicitly requested
- implemented by adding the @Lazy annotation to a given class
- can set a global configuration instead of tedious work:
	spring.main.lazy-initialization=true
	-> all beans are lazy (no beans created until needed)
	-> includes the DemoController

ADVANTAGES:
- only create objects as needed
- helps with faster startup time if there are large number of components

DISADVANTAGES: 
- web related components not created until requested (@RestController)
- may not discover configuration issues until too late
- need enough memory for all beans once created
