# MYSQL DATABASE #
Includes two components:
	1. MySQL Database Server
	2. MySQL Workbench

# Install MySQL Server for Ubuntu / Linux OS #
Update OS with command:
sudo apt-get update -y

Install MySQL Server:
sudo apt install mysql-server

Check the server status:
sudo service mysql status

Check the network status:
sudo ss -tap | grep mysql

If server is not running correctly, can restart with:
sudo service mysql restart

For troubleshooting problems with systemd journal:
sudo journalctl -u mysql

# Install MySQL Workbench for Ubuntu / Linux OS #
Update OS with command:
sudo apt-get update -y 

Install the workbench with command:
sudo apt install mysql-workbench

# CREATE SERVER SCRIPTS #
01-create-user.sql
	- create new MySQl user for app
		-> user id: springstudent
		-> password: springstudent

02-student-tracker.sql
	- create new database student

# SETTING UP MYSQL WORKBENCH #
By default, since mysql-workbench-community is installed via snap, 
the package is sandboxed as usual and by default not allowed access

To allow access enter the command:
sudo snap connect mysql-workbench-community:password-manager-service :password-manager-service

Enter the next command in a terminal:
sudo mysql -u root

Enter command to alter password (where 'pass' is the password):
ALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'pass';
