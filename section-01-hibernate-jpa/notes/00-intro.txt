# HIBERNATE #
Definition: A framework for persisting / saving Java objects in a database
- handles all low-level SQL
- minimizes amount of JDBC code
- provides Object-to-Relational Mapping (ORM)
- developer defines mapping between Java class and database table

# JPA #
Definition: Jakarta (previously Java) Persistence API (JPA)

Only a specification:
	- standard API for Object-to-Relational Mapping (ORM)
	- defines set of interfaces
	- requires implementation to be usable

Benefits of JPA
	- not locked into vendor's implementation since it is a standard API
	- portable, flexible code by coding to JPA spec (interfaces)
	- theoretically can switch vendor implemenations without lock in

CRUD
C - create objects
R - read objects
U - update objects
D - delete objects

# HOW DOES HIBERNATE / JPA RELATE TO JDBC #
- both use JDBC for all database communication
