# AUTOMATIC DATA SOURCE CONFIGURATION #
- Hibernate is the default implementation on JPA
- EntityManager is main component for creating queries etc.
- EntityManager is from Jakarta Persistence API (JPA)
- Based on configs, beans will get created: DataSource, EntityManager, etc.
	-> Spring Boot can inject these beans into app, for example the DAO
- Automatically configure data source
- Read database connection info from application.properties file
- No need to provide JDBC driver class name, automatically detected from URL

Add dependencies:
- MySQL (JDBC) Driver: mysql-connector-j
- Spring Data (ORM) JPA: spring-boot-starter-data-jpa

# GOAL: CREATE SPRING BOOT COMMAND LINE APP #
- Focus on Hibernate / JPA
- Later in the course, will apply to a CRUD REST API
